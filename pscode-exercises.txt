// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c
Print c.


(Examples from class:

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers
add the 2 number together
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers)





// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number is divided by 2, print 0.
If number is not divided by 2, print 1.





// Exercise 3:
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  

read number1
read number2
read number3
read number4
read number5

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

Add number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5 to determine number6.
Divide number6 by 5 to get number7.
Print number7.

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

Minimum:
If number1 < number2, then number1 is smaller.
Repeat with remaining numbers.
Print smallest number.

Maximum:
If number1 > number2, then number1 is greater.
Repeat with remaining numbers.
Print greatest number.


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Step b result is number7: the result of adding all available numbers and dividing the sum by the quantity of numbers added.

Step c result is the smallest and largest numbers: each number is compared with another until the smallest and largest numbers are discovered.
